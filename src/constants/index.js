export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am an enthusiastic full stack developer with a talent for building resilient and scalable web applications. I have sharpened my abilities in front-end frameworks like React and Next.js, along with back-end technologies including Node.js, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python, and Java. My aim is to use my expertise to develop cutting-edge solutions that fuel business growth and provide outstanding user experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I have a strong background in programming, specializing in React.js, Python, and SQL, which enables me to create innovative and efficient solutions. My skills extend to graphic design with a focus on UX/UI, allowing me to build user-friendly and visually appealing applications. Beyond coding, I have a deep passion for football, where I play as a central midfielder. Music is another creative outlet for me, as I enjoy playing the guitar and experimenting with different melodies. Cooking, particularly baking bread, is a hobby that I find both relaxing and rewarding, as I love trying out new recipes. I admire Gordon Ramsay for his culinary expertise and aspire to develop my skills further. While these interests are fulfilling, coding remains my true passion, driving me to continuously learn and push the boundaries of my creativity and technical abilities..`;
